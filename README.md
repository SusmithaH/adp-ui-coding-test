# Task Approval System

Problem: Design a Task Approval System, based on the mock api provided.

Requirements:
1. Integrate with the mock api : `http://localhost:3001/getTasks` to get the list of tasks
2. Sort the tasks and ensure that 'AWAITING_APPROVAL' tasks are shown first
3. Upon approval or rejection of the task, update the store

Note: You don't have to create any new components as they are ready out of the box. Please refer to the components section below to lear about their usage. 

## Test Environment Setup
In the project directory, run the following commands:

```
cd .\adp-ui-coding-test\
npm install
npm start

cd .\sample-api\
npm install
npm start

```
